# README 
	Lab 7 includes 3 files, main.c, addNum.c and the Makefile. The goal of the program is to add a sum and print it.

## Common commands
	'The right side of the Makefile is the target where the two files that were already created are put. 
	The files are written in C language. I couldn't find any help with Java so I had to try something with C. The program make helps you call multiple files in one file and makes the program by just written make.
