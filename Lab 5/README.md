# CISC3140
Labs and assignments for the Brooklyn College Web Apps class

P.S Sorry for this commiting issues. I was doing it last minute. I had some problems with pushing the repo from my console, and had to push it using the github.com last minute.

Description:
1. Lab-5/a1output.txt represents my commands I was using to print values of the csv file.
2. Lab-5/a2output.txt represents the data I moved using shell.sh file
3. Lab-5/a3out.put.txt represents the commands I used to write shell script to start the tictactoe game that I created earlier. The game's "Gameplay" is also there.
