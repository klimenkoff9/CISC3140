Scheme Learning Experience

Scheme is a very hard language to understand and work with, way harder than more sociaty acceptable languages such as Java or Python. 
Even C didn't look that hard in comparision with Scheme.
The syntax used for mathematical operations is infix notation which is a little different. 
The biggest trouble were the parentheses and now I will never be mad on Java for being so difficult with semicolumns. 
The idea that you need to use parentheses before writing the method, and the method goes inside the parentheses was a completely a new thing for me. 
Writing lambda expressions was tricky because I had to use recursion, however it helped me to understand it better (even with  other languages).
Running Scheme was done by changing the mode of the file making it visible and callingit through it's path. 
The thinking that had to be done through conditionals was also different, and making liststs reminded me of arrays that were created. I had to make sure I used '() and defined the list before hand so I don't have to create the list everytime. 
It was an interesting exeprience making different algorithms, that I've done in Java, but the way of writing it made a lot of change.
If Python and Java were English and French, Scheme is Russian.  Overall it was similar in logic but the syntax made a big difference.
My IDE also wasn't very frienly with Scheme so I had to make up some space on my computer for DrRacket IDE. 
A good thing that my previous expirience tought me to watch YouTube in order to find help with programming and it helped me out this time too.
